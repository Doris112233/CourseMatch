Warner Hall 104\\\n***Discussion sections (various times and\\\nlocations)***\\\n\n\\f2\\i\\b Note: this is a required component of the course\\\n\n\\f0\\i0 Instructor\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 Nathan Wendte (he/him)\\\n\\cf3 sdb2qj@virginia.edu\\\n\\cf2 Office hours: by appointment in Brooks Hall\\\n104B or via Zoom\\\n\\cf3 Make office hours appointment here\\\n\n\\f0\\b \\cf2 Teaching Assistant\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 Emilia Gonzalez (she/her)\\\n\\cf3 nhd6gb@virginia.edu\\\n\\cf2 Office hours: by appointment in Brooks Hall\\\nCommons or via Zoom\\\n\n\\f0\\b Course description, goals, & objectives\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 Can we be who we are without language? Would you be someone \n\\f3\\i else \n\\f1\\i0 if you spoke a \n\\f3\\i different\\\n\n\\f1\\i0 language? The ways in which humans use and evaluate linguistic behaviors are deeply ingrained\\\nin who we are and how we see the world both individually and collectively. This course is your\\\ninvitation to the nexus of language, culture, and society. No prior knowledge is assumed\\'97all you\\\nneed is your curiosity. We will discuss, debate, and reflect upon topics such as how linguists\\\nanalyze data, how anthropologists link language and thought, how language is performed and\\\nreceived, and how our identities are reflected in and altered by communication. While by no\\\nmeans a comprehensive investigation of linguistic anthropology, this course will provide you with a\\\nbroad familiarity with the many ways this field is applicable to daily life. Together we will\\\ndiscover some surprising ways in which our lives are lived through language.\\\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\\\n\n\\f4\\fs20 \\'95\n\\f5  \n\\f1\\fs24 Define language and differentiate it from other forms of social behavior\\\n\n\\f4\\fs20 \\'95\n\\f5  \n\\f1\\fs24 Describe specific facets of linguistic behavior and consider how these are (or are not)\\\nassociated with cultural differences\\\n\n\\f4\\fs20 \\'95\n\\f5  \n\\f1\\fs24 Explore the ways in which language reflects your personal identity and the identities\\\nof others\\\n\n\\f4\\fs20 \\'95\n\\f5  \n\\f1\\fs24 Recognize the importance of how we think about language and how these attitudes\\\ncome to bear on social norms and structures\\\n\n\\f4\\fs20 \\'95\n\\f5  \n\\f1\\fs24 Appreciate the capacity of language to affect socio-cultural change\\\n\n\\f4\\fs20 \\'95\n\\f5  \n\\f1\\fs24 Discern linguistic bias in daily life and identify opportunities to support and\\\ncooperate with members of linguistically marginalized communities\\\n\n\\f0\\b Course structure\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 We meet as a large group on Mondays and Wednesdays (though note some exceptions to this on\\\nour calendar), and you will also meet in smaller discussion sections on either Thursday or Friday.\n\\f2\\i\\b  If\\\nyou have not yet signed up for a discussion section, please make sure that you do\\'97it is a necessary\\\ncomponent of this course.\\\n\n\\f1\\i0\\b0 Mondays will generally be dedicated to reviewing the concepts of a given chapter from a broad\\\nperspective. This does not mean that the chapter will be reviewed in its entirety, however, soplease make sure that readings are completed ahead of time. Prior to our meeting, I will look for\\\nyou to make a 100-word post (via Canvas\\'92s Discussions tool) that contains: a question you had\\\nafter the reading, a point of agreement/disagreement you had after the reading, or a comment\\\non how the reading affected your understanding.\\\nWednesdays will usually involve either a deeper dive into a subset of the chapter\\'92s concepts or\\\nan application of these concepts to some real-world example. Following our meeting, I will look\\\nfor you to make a 50-word reply to the original comments you had ahead of Monday\\'92s lecture. It\\\nis permissible to reply to your own previous post. Access to this discussion forum will end prior to\\\nthe next week\\'92s first lecture. \n\\f2\\i\\b Students may miss up to five discussion posts and still receive full credit\\\nfor this component of the course.\\\n\n\\f1\\i0\\b0 Finally, in your discussion sections, you will meet in small groups with the course\\'92s Teaching\\\nAssistant to discuss the finer points of the chapter or unit and explore their connection to your lives.\\\nThis is when you are most encouraged to bring your questions and concerns, although these are\\\ncertainly welcome at any other point as well.\\\n\n\\f0\\b Lecture materials policy\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 Students whose SDAC accommodations recommend copies of lecture slides and/or recordings of\\\nlecture audio will be provided access on an as-needed basis. Students who cannot attend lecture\\\ndue to illness or other acceptable extenuating circumstance (\n\\f3\\i e.g.\n\\f1\\i0 , pre-approved travel, late\\\nenrollment, etc.) may request access to these materials within 48 hours of the initial absence\\\n(\\cf3 request access via this form\\cf2 ). Such access will not be provided outside of the provisions of this\\\npolicy, subject to instructor\\'92s discretion. If you are unsure whether or not a circumstance is\\\nacceptable, please send the instructor an email (\\cf3 sdb2qj@virginia.edu\\cf2 ).\\\nPlease note that lecture sessions for this course will be recorded. Recordings will only include\\\naudio and will be deleted at the end of the semester. They may not be reproduced, shared with\\\nthose not enrolled in the course, or uploaded to any other online environments. If having your\\\nvoice potentially recorded is an issue, please contact me so that I am aware. Students in a class\\\nare prohibited from recording of any kind unless authorization is obtained from the instructor.\\\n\n\\f2\\i\\b Lecture recordings are not intended to replace attendance.\\\n\n\\f0\\i0 Course materials\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 All course materials will be made available via Canvas; \n\\f2\\i\\b you will be regularly required to access\\\nCanvas during lecture via a phone, tablet, or laptop\\\n\n\\f0\\i0 Evaluation\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 Student grades will be determined by:\\\nQuizzes: 20%\\\nParticipation: 25%\\\nExams: 30%\\\nFinal project: 30%\\\n\n\\f0\\b Quizzes (20%)\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 Reading comprehension and oral comprehension are core components of critical thinking, and\\\nquizzes are meant to reinforce these skills. During most lecture meetings, there will be an in-class\\\nquiz related to the reading(s) that were assigned for that day. The answers to each quiz\\'92squestions will be given within the lecture, but it is your responsibility to be paying attention and\\\ntaking notes so that you can recognize them when they appear. Quizzes double as a stand-in for\\\nattendance, which is crucial in order to keep pace with material being covered over the course of\\\nthe semester. \n\\f2\\i\\b Your five lowest quiz scores will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\\f1\\i0\\b0  Quizzes\\\ncannot be made up.\\\n\n\\f0\\b Participation (25%)\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 Come to lecture and section prepared and primed to think actively. Be ready to share your\\\nthoughts, concerns, and questions. Participation can look different for different students\\'97some\\\nmay welcome the opportunity to talk in our full-class meetings while others may be more\\\ncomfortable speaking in small groups or discussion sections. I encourage you to challenge\\\nyourselves by participating in ways that may feel uncomfortable at times, but I also want to\\\nassure you that participation is much more than raising your hand in a crowded classroom.\\\nThrough your questions, comments, responses, and attendance, I will be striving to gauge your\\\ninvolvement with the material in multiple ways. \n\\f2\\i\\b Posting to weekly Canvas discussion topics is\\\nincluded in this portion of your grade\n\\f1\\i0\\b0 .\\\n\n\\f0\\b Exams (30%)\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 There will be two take-home exams given during the semester. The purpose of these tests is to\\\nensure your mastery of the course concepts introduced up to that point. Our material builds on\\\nitself, so checking your progress along the way guarantees that you stay on track to achieve the\\\ncourse\\'92s objectives. Students are expected to complete their own work, but these are open-note\\\nexams. \n\\f2\\i\\b Once exams have been graded and returned, corrections may be submitted to potentially\\\nearn back up to 75% of the total points missed. Exam resubmissions will be due within 3 weeks of\\\nreceiving initial grades.\\\n\n\\f0\\i0 Final project (30%)\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 Early in the semester, you will be assigned to teams of ~5 people. In these groups, you will create\\\nan informational video on some concept tied to the relationship between language and culture\\\nand how it manifests in daily life. The topic you cover is up to you and your group (The TA(s) and I\\\nare available to offer suggestions/guidance), but your final video must be aimed at a non-\\\nspecialist, high school audience. Group work can be intimidating, but we will go over strategies to\\\nnavigate the assignment as well as check in with one another regarding your progress. You will\\\nhave the chance to give and receive feedback to and from your peers as well as an opportunity\\\nto reflect on the process from an individual perspective. Each component of this project will\\\ncontribute in part to the overall grade. More specific guidance will be provided later on.\\\n\n\\f0\\b Grading scale\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 A = > 94% A- = 90% \\'96 94% B+ = 87% \\'96 89% B = 84% \\'96 86% B- = 80% \\'96 83% C+ = 77% \\'96 79%\\\nC = 74% \\'96 76%\\\nC- = 70% \\'96 73%\\\nD = 60% \\'96 69%\\\nF = < 60%\\\n\n\\f2\\i\\b Note: Do NOT rely on Canv",

The time and location will be announced in class and will\\\nshift during the semester to accommodate assignments and exams.\\\nLectures: MWF 11-11:50 am, Clark Hall 108\\\nCourse website: Canvas\\\n\n\\f0\\b What this course is about\\\n\n\\f2\\b0 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f3  \n\\f0\\b Description: \n\\f1\\b0 \\cf4 This is the introductory class for geosciences and a core class for all majors in Environmental\\\nSciences. We study the composition, structure, and internal processes of earth; the organizing framework of\\\nplate tectonics; the perspective of deep time and geologic reasoning; and intersections between the solid\\\nEarth and society through natural resources and hazards.\\\n\n\\f2 \\cf2 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f3  \n\\f0\\b Objectives: \n\\f1\\b0 Through this course, you will: (1) earn about the materials that form the solid Earth, and the\\\nprocesses that shape it; (2) Stretch your senses of space and time to explore the past, present, and future of\\\nour planet; and (3) engage geologic data to make observations, form interpretations, and solve problems.\\\n\n\\f2 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f3  \n\\f0\\b Prerequisites:\n\\f1\\b0  This course is part of the core class sequence for majors in Environmental Sciences. As such,\\\nyou will be expected to read widely \\cf5 (1) \n\\f0\\b read\n\\f1\\b0  widely, from textbooks, broad-audience sources and scientific\\\nliterature;\n\\f0\\b \\cf4  \n\\f1\\b0 (2)\n\\f0\\b  write\n\\f1\\b0  in short and multi-page formats; and (3) use \n\\f0\\b quantitative reasoning\n\\f1\\b0  commensurate\\\nwith \\cf3 prerequisites for majors\\cf4  in Environmental Sciences, including introductory math (i.e., \\cf5 manipulating\\\nequations using algebra\\cf4 ). \\cf2 One semester of college chemistry (e.g., CHEM 1410) is helpful, but not required.\\\n\\cf4 If you have questions or concerns about these expectations, please see me to discuss in early in the semester.\\\n\n\\f0\\b \\cf2 Course mechanics\\\n\n\\f2\\b0 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f4\\b  \n\\f0 Schedule:\n\\f1\\b0  An up-to-date schedule is maintained on Canvas. Please use the website to keep current with all\\\naspects of the class, including lectures, readings, assignments and office hours. The class structure includes\\\nthree weekly class periods; attendance is expected for all class periods. I strongly recommend concurrent\\\nenrollment in the laboratory section (EVSC 2801: Fundamentals of Geology Laboratory), which meets once\\\nper week. Labs meet on weekdays at 2 pm in 112 Warner Hall.\\\n\n\\f2 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f4\\b  \n\\f0 Office hours: \n\\f1\\b0 I encourage you to come to office hours at any point during the semester to discuss the class\\\nor your broader academic interests. These visits are often informal and can help further personalize your\\\nexperience in class. You are welcome to email me with questions or comments about class content; if so, I\\\nmay discuss the question during lecture for the benefit of the whole class.\\\n\n\\f2 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f4\\b  \n\\f0 Course materials: \n\\f1\\b0 The required course textbook is \n\\f5\\i Essentials of Geology\n\\f1\\i0 , 7\n\\fs16 th\n\\fs24  edition, by Stephen Marshak.\\\n(Somewhat older editions are ok if you are willing to transpose page numbers). Additional readings will\\\ndraw from various sources. You will get the most out of this class if you complete the readings before the\\\ncorresponding lecture to help seed topics and questions for in-class discussion. Assignments require word\\\nprocessing and spreadsheet software (Microsoft Word and Excel, or similar).\\\n\n\\f2 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f4\\b  \n\\f0 Participation in class discussions: \n\\f1\\b0 The purpose of convening in the classroom is so that we can build an\\\nintellectual community, learn from one another, and have fun discussing big ideas. We will cover a broadrange of topics in class, including many unresolved mysteries about the planets. So bring your curiosity, ask\\\nquestions (including during lectures), and share your scientific ideas with the class.\\\n\n\\f2 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f4\\b  \n\\f0 Absences and extensions: \n\\f1\\b0 I understand that you may occasionally need to miss class due to unforeseen\\\ncircumstances (e.g., illness, family emergency) or pre-scheduled university or professional events. I ask that\\\nyou avoid email for extension requests, and instead submit your request using the \n\\f0\\b web form\n\\f1\\b0  linked at\\\nCanvas.\n\\f0\\b  \n\\f1\\b0 Requests must be submitted\n\\f0\\b  before\n\\f1\\b0  the corresponding due date. The request form will ask you to\\\nprovide a rationale that we will evaluate. I trust you to follow the Honor Code and exercise discretion in\\\nrequesting extensions. If requests become frequent I may ask you to provide supporting documentation (e.g.,\\\ndoctor\\'92s note).\n\\f0\\b  \n\\f1\\b0 If you are having trouble keeping up with class,\n\\f0\\b  \n\\f1\\b0 please reach out as soon as possible to me\\\nand your Association Dean\n\\f0\\b  \n\\f1\\b0 (\\cf3 https://college.as.virginia.edu/association-deans\\cf2 ).\\\n\n\\f0\\b Grading\\\n\n\\f2\\b0 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f3  \n\\f0\\b Components: \n\\f1\\b0 Your grade in the class will reflect performance on assignments (40%), reading quizzes\\\n(10%), midterm exams (20%) and a final exam (30%).\\cf4  \\cf2 Assignments are designed to develop quantitative\\\nproblem solving and critical thinking through structured writing. Quizzes are designed to encourage you to\\\nkeep up with readings and come prepared for in-class discussions. The midterm and final exams will include\\\nmultiple choice, short answer, and illustration questions and cover material from lectures, readings and\\\nassignments. Course grades will be updated throughout the semester using Canvas Gradebook.\\\n\n\\f2 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f3  \n\\f0\\b Final grades:\n\\f1\\b0  Throughout the semester, grading will sometimes include leniency in the form of partial\\\ncredit for incorrect answers on assignment and exams to help you identify ways to improve your\\\nunderstanding or scientific communication skills. Final course grades will be calculated using the scale\\\nbelow. \n\\f0\\b I do not grade on a curve, and out of fairness I will not round up grades\n\\f1\\b0 .\\\n\n\\f0\\b Letter\\\nMin.\\\nLetter\\\nMin.\\\nLetter\\\nMin.\\\nLetter\\\nMin.\\\nLetter\\\ngrade\\\nscore:\\\ngrade\\\nscore:\\\ngrade\\\nscore:\\\ngrade\\\nscore:\\\ngrade\\\n\n\\f1\\b0 A+ 98 B+ 88 C+ 78 D+ 68 F <60\\\nA 94 B 84 C 74 D 64\\\nA- 90 B- 80 C- 70 D- 60\\\n\n\\f0\\b Ethical conduct in class\\\n\n\\f2\\b0 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f4\\b  \n\\f0 Computers \n\\f1\\b0 are essential tools, but used the wrong way, can undermine learning. Please be mindful of how\\\nyou use technology in this class:\\\n\n\\f6\\b o\n\\f4  \n\\f5\\i\\b0 In the classroom:\n\\f1\\i0  You are free to use a laptop or tablet computer in class for activities that support your\\\nlearning \\'96 specifically taking notes, accessing Canvas, or completing an in-class exercise. Using a\\\ndigital device in a way that is unrelated to the class \\'96 including for email, social media, messaging,\\\nreading the news, etc. \\'96 harms your learning and is distracting to those seated around you. If you decide\\\nyou absolutely need to use a computer for a purpose that is not related to class, please do so outside the\\\nclassroom. If you are using a computer in a way that is interrupting the students around you, or is\\\ndistracting me from teaching, I will ask you to stop.\\\n\n\\f6\\b o\n\\f4  \n\\f5\\i\\b0 Generative Artificial Intelligence\n\\f1\\i0 :\n\\f0\\b  \n\\f1\\b0 A core objective of this class is for you to develop in using writing to\\\norganize your thoughts, and to think creatively and independently. These are skills that only grow with\\\npractice, and much of this course is structured around helping you build that practice. Therefore, I\\\nexpect that you will complete all assignments in this class, and especially writing assignments, without\\\ngenerative AI such as ChatGPT unless you obtain permission from me. If you think there is a creative\\\nway to use this technology in your work, let\\'92s talk about it in office hours first.\\\n\n\\f2 \\uc0\\u10146 \n\\f4\\b  \n\\f0 Honor Code: \n\\f1\\b0 By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the Honor System of the\\\nUniversity of Virginia, as well as the following policies specific to the Department of Environmental\\\nSciences and this course: 1)\n\\f0\\b  \n\\f1\\b0 Given the availability of old exams, worked problem sets, and laboratory\\\nexercises from online services and other venues, the Environmental Sciences Department considers student\\\naccess of these materials for Environmental Sciences courses, without explicit instructor permission, to be a\\\nviolation of the UVA Honor Code. 2) Student collaboration is encouraged for in-class activities. However,\n\\f0\\b all take-home assignments and exams must be completed by you (not co-authored or copied from\\\nothers). \n\\f1\\b0 Reports also require appropriate citations for any cal",

    "syllabus": "CS 2100 Syllabus Static Information\n\nSyllabus\nCS 2100 - Data Structures and Algorithms 1\n\u2014 Course Description\nA second course in computing with an emphasis on foundational data structures and program\nanalysis. The course provides a comprehensive look at the Java programming language including objectoriented programming, concurrency, inheritance / polymorphism. Additionally, foundational data\nstructures and related algorithms / analysis are studied. These include Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash\nTables, and Priority Queues.\n\u2014 Illness and other absences: Safety and Respect\nYour safety and comfort are important to us. In this course, we will diligently follow all University\nregulations. It is in the best interest of everyone in our community to keep the spread of infectious disease\nto a minimum. Students who are ill should stay away from classes, even on days when quizzes or exams\nare given. If you need to miss class due to illness or career development (interviews, conferences, and\nother events that support your growth as a computing professional) or other university sanctioned event,\nthere is no need to notify anyone.\nIf you\u2019re not feeling well, please call Student Health at (434) 924-5362; for all our safety and health,\nplease stay at home and watch the recorded lecture\u2013whether you might think it\u2019s a cold or just seasonal\nallergies. At least one professor will record their lecture. We will ensure that staying home does not\nimpact your grade compared to being in person, so that you can take the time you need to get better,\nquarantine, or isolate as needed. See specific information about missing labs or exams.\n\u2014 Prerequisites\nTo be successful, students should have the equivalent of one semester of programming knowledge\n(specific language does not matter), as demonstrated by any of the following:\n\u25cf Have taken CS 1110/1111/1112/1120 with a C- or better.\n\u25cf Have credit on your transcript for an equivalent course from high school or another university.\n\u25cf Passed the CS 1110 place-out exam, AP exam, IB exam, etc.\n[Info on CS 1110 place-out exam: https://engineering.virginia.edu/introduction-programmingand-place-out-tests ]\n\u25cb It must be turned in by 3:30pm the first Friday of the semester to be used as a\nprerequisite for this course. Contact the CS Office (cs-student-support@virginia.edu) for\nfurther information.\nIf you feel you have not met these prerequisites, please contact the instructors immediately.\n\u2014 Course Objectives (ABET Course Objectives)\nBy the end of the semester, students should be able to:\n\u25cf Understand how to write programs in Java, including all basic structures (e.g., if-statements,\nloops, functions), recursion, objects, methods, inheritance / polymorphism, and exception\nthrowing / handling.\n\n1\n\n\fCS 2100 Syllabus Static Information\n\u25cf\n\nUnderstand and implement several key data structures, required for a foundational education in\ncomputer science. These data structures include Vectors, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary\nSearch Trees, AVL Trees, Hash Tables, and Priority Queues.\n\u25cf Understand and implement various sorting methods, including bubble sort, insertion sort,\nmergesort, quicksort, and heapsort.\n\u25cf Understand and analyze program analysis using practical approaches (e.g., mergesort vs.\nquicksort) and theoretical approaches (e.g., balanced vs. unbalanced search trees). This will\ninclude both space and time complexity analyses.\n\u25cf Gather an abstract and basic understanding of concurrency and associated issues (shared\nresources, etc.). Students will be able to implement simple multi-threaded programs in Java.\n\u2014 Attendance\nAttendance in labs is mandatory if you intend to pass the class (because the quizzes are taken in lab).\nClass attendance is encouraged, but not required. Lectures will be recorded by the instructors, but\nsometimes there are technical issues, and the recordings are not available. We will try and make the time\nyou spend in class with us a good investment of your time.\n\u2014 Professionalism\nIn this course, being kind, respectful, supportive, compassionate, and mindful of others is essential.\nUnprofessional behavior, such as misbehavior towards instructors/classmates/TAs, disrupting class, not\nfollowing University regulations, consistently missing assignment deadlines, misuse of class platforms\n(e.g., Piazza), or causing distractions for other students, can and will be held against a student when final\ngrades are calculated (up to 20% course grade penalty).\n\u2014 Special Circumstances / SDAC\nThe University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. It is our goal in this course to\ncreate a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the\nformat, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with us outside of class so we can explore\npotential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access\nCenter (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official\naccommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically\nlocated in Engineering. You may email her at cmacmasters@virginia.edu to schedule an appointment. For\ngeneral questions please visit the SDAC website: sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu. If you have already\nbeen approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet\nwith me so we can develop an implementation plan together.\n\u2014 Religious Accommodations\nIt is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they\ndo not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances\nconflict with academic requirements.\nStudents who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their\nrequest to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about\nacademic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University\u2019s\nOffice for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200.\n\n2\n\n\fNO\nCS 2100 Syllabus Static Information\n\n\u2014 Instructor Availability\nIt is important to us to be available to our students, and to address their concerns.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more\ninformation can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and\nresources available - www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence.\nThe same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for\ndiscrimination, harassment, and retaliation. UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age,\ncolor, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status,\nmilitary status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related\nconditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation\nfor reporting such behavior.\nIf you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to\nsubmit a report to Just Report It (justreportit.virginia.edu) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal\nOpportunity and Civil Rights.\nIf you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not\nreported to the University, you can turn to Counseling & Psychological Services (\u201cCAPS\u201d) and Women\u2019s\nCenter Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).\nAs your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to\nprovide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means\nthat I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you\nreport to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the\nreporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether\nfurther action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community.\n\u2014 Support for Your Career Development\nEngaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example,\npresenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an\nextern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in\nand of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development.\nTo that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate\naccommodations. Note, any accommodations will not extend beyond the last day of finals for the\nsemester.\n\u2014 Student Support Team\nYou have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In\naddition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in\nThornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait\nuntil the end of the semester to ask for help!\n\n4\n\n\fCS 2100 Syllabus Static Information\n\nLearning\nLisa Lampe, Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Affairs\nGeorgina Nembhard, Director of Student Success\nCourtney MacMas",

All students who aspire to be\ndecision-makers and leaders, regardless of functional area of expertise, must understand the basic principles\nof finance and how to discuss financial concepts. We study how to read and interpret financial statements,\nwhat the time value of money is, how to value projects, bonds, and stocks, and how to think about common\nissues in capital budgeting.\n3. REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\na. Canvas. Lecture notes, slides, homework assignments, and other learning resources will be posted on\nCanvas. We expect you to check the website for updates regularly.\nb. Textbook. You will be required to read selections from \u201cCorporate Finance, 6th Edition\u201d by Jonathan Berk\nand Peter DeMarzo; published by Pearson; ISBN-13: 978-0137844906 (eText) or 978-0137845026 (print).\n\n\fThe 3Y finance course along with several other upper-level finance courses use this same textbook,\nand it is an industry standard.\nThe default option is the perpetual access eBook for $47.05 and is available via Inclusive Access at\nthe UVA Bookstore.\nWe will be requiring that you read selections of the text, but there will be no MyLab component. All\nthat is required of you is that you have access to the text.\nFor this course, you are welcome to use previous editions of the textbook.\nInclusive Access: This course will take part in the Inclusive Access program at the UVA Bookstore.\nThis service provides immediate access to the text through Canvas. To access the digital materials,\nlog in to your Canvas course site, click on the UVA Digital Tab, and follow the instructions there.\nStudent accounts will be charged on September 9, 2025. If you decide that you do not want to\npurchase these required materials, you can opt out of the program by clicking \u201cOPT-OUT\u201d, which will\nremove your access to these materials through Canvas. If you choose to opt-out, you must do so by\nSeptember 8, 2025. If you drop the course on or before the September 8, 2025 deadline your\nstudent account will be refunded. If you drop the course after September 8, 2025, email proof of\ndropping the course to textbook@virginia.edu and a refund will be issued to your student account. If\nyou have any questions regarding the program, please email textbook@virginia.edu or call 434-9241045.\nClarification: Inclusive Access is opt-out. If you buy your own copy of the text \u201con the economy\u201d, you\nmust opt out of Inclusive Access by September 8, or you will be charged.\nc. ExPrep. Excel is a standard tool in the professional world. This course is not an excel course, but we will\nspend some time working through Excel examples in class and you will be assigned three brief cases over\nthe course of the semester to be completed in Excel. These assignments will be downloaded and\nsubmitted using ExPrep, a spreadsheet grading tool.\nYou are required to purchase ExPrep ($35) for this course.\nYou will always access ExPrep via Canvas.\nTo get started, go to Canvas -> Topic 0 -> \u201cBrief Case 0 - ExPrep Student Orientation Assignment\u201d\nPlease contact ExPrep directly if you have issues: https://support.excelpreparation.com/knowledge\nIf you are brand new to Excel, we highly recommend that you take some Excel courses on LinkedIn\nLearning. UVA has a subscription for this, so you can take these courses for free. In particular, we\nrecommend the courses outlined in the \u201cExcel for Finance and Real Estate\u201d pdf, which you can find in\nModule 0.\nd. Calculator. For homework assignments you can use whatever tools you like. For exams, you may use any\ncalculator so long as it does not have internet access \u2013 phones and laptops will not be allowed. The\nquestions on the exams will be conceptual problems and math problems. We highly recommend the\ncheap and basic, but highly useable and intuitive, Texas Instruments 30X. Graphing calculators without\n\n\finternet access, like the TI-84, are acceptable if you already have one, but not necessary. You may use a\nfinancial calculator \u2013 like the Texas Instruments BAII Plus \u2013 if you want, but we\u2019re not huge fans and will\nnot be teaching with it. The exams will require calculator use and we highly recommend you spend time\nduring the semester practicing with your preferred calculator.\n4. GRADING, ASSIGNMENTS, AND EXAMS\na. Course Grade. Your grade will be based on the following deliverables:\nBrief Cases (3 @ 33.33 points each)\nCanvas Assignments (6 @20 points)\nIn Class Exam 1\nIn Class Exam 2\nFinal Exam\n\n100 points\n100 points\n250 points\n250 points\n300 points\n\nWe reserve the right to adjust the above for any reason.\nb.

The earlier\nyou fill us in, the more time we have to work out a solution.\n\nAccommodations: See SDAC section below.\ne. Attendance and Participation. Students are expected to attend all class meetings.\nCold calling is an important part of COMM 2002.\nPhones and laptops must be put away during class.

Lectures will be recorded and\nposted.\nPlease bring your name cards with you to every lecture and have them propped up in front of you\nbefore class begins.\nf. Grade",

    "syllabus": "\ufeffECON 2010 - Principles of Microeconomics\r\nSpring 2025\r\n \r\nPersonal Note from Prof. Doyle:\r\nWelcome to Principles of Microeconomics.  I am excited to teach this course and glad that you are taking it! \r\nMy goal for the course is to help you learn more about microeconomics.  I am genuinely concerned about you and want to help you satisfy your academic curiosity.   So, you will get exposure to microeconomic concepts and models.  We will use our models to analyze real world economic problems and issues.\r\nPlease let me know how I can serve you.  Now, let's have a great semester!\r\n \r\nProfessor: Carter Doyle\r\nEmail: carterdoyle@virginia.edu   \r\nOffice: Elson 163A\r\nOffice Hours:  Monday and Wednesday 2:30-4:00pm, and by appointment.\r\nI encourage you to stop by during my office hours to get help.          \r\n \r\nThe TA's for your discussion section will provide you their contact info and office hours for the semester before the end of the first week of classes.\r\n \r\nTextbook and Other Materials: \r\n-Textbook: Microeconomics, by Colander. \r\n-Study Guide posted by Prof Doyle\r\n-Occasional articles, posted on Canvas, will be assigned for reading and class discussion. \r\n \r\nPrerequisite:  No official prerequisite.\r\n \r\nLectures:\r\nLecture attendance is strongly encouraged.  It is our opportunity to learn from each other and discuss what is going on in the economy and markets.  Please arrive on time for classes and make sure you are not doing anything to disrupt the lecture, or your fellow classmates - this includes doing things in \"silence\" - e.g., watching things on your laptop/tablet, or engaging in social media, which may be distracting to those sitting behind you.  If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to ask a fellow student about anything you missed.\r\n \r\nCourse Grade:\r\n \r \r \r \r \rItem\rPoints\r \r \rQuiz 1\r20\r \r \rQuiz 2\r20\r \r \rTest 1\r100\r \r \rTest 2\r100\r \r \rFinal\r200\r \r \rClass Participation\r40\r \r \r TA Points\r20\r \r \rTotal Points\r500\r \r \r \r \r \r\r \r \r All Quizzes and Exams will be taken during class time in our regular classroom \r\n Class Participation will consists of playing Kahoot! games involving questions to help you  understand the material, and also article discussions that are related to the material.\r\n \r\nDutch Knockout: \r\nYour grade for the course is based on the higher of the following: \r\n1)  grade from the entire semester's work (including final exam), or\r\n2)  grade on the final exam only.   Thus, if you do not do as well on other tests and\r\n3)  assignments, it may be possible to still receive a good grade by doing well on the\r\nfinal exam.\r\n \r\nCourse grades are set according to a scale, which is determined the day after the\r\nfinal exam.  Thus, tests are not assigned letter grades.\r\n \r\nMakeup Tests: \r\nThe Final Exam will take the place for those who missed either the first or the second\r\ntest and have an acceptable excuse.  Acceptable excuses are rare; examples include\r\ndeath in the family, or serious illness. You must submit an excuse with proper documentation\r\n that must be approved by the professor within 1 week after the missed test.\r\n \r\nFinal Exam: \r\nThere is ONE final examination.  You must take the Final Exam at the University scheduled\r\ntime.  There is no makeup for the final exam.\r\n \r\nGrading Questions: \r\nIf you have any questions about grading of a test or assignment, please contact\r\nthe TA first.  If you are not satisfied, then please see me.  You must do this within 1\r\nweek of the assignment or test date.\r\nAdd, Drop, and Withdrawal:\r\nPlease see the University's website for dates about adding, dropping, and withdrawing. \r\nIt is the student's responsibility to be familiar with university polices associated with Add,\r\n Drop, and Withdrawal and to take such actions on their own behalf, if the student deems\r\nit appropriate.\r\n \r\nCredit/No Credit:\r\nFor students taking the course credit/no credit, the minimum grade for credit is a C-. \r\n \r\n \r\nSDAC/Disabilities:\r\nIf you are an SDAC student, You are responsible for making appointments in advance (do it at\r\nthe beginning of the semester) to take lecture Quizzes and Exams at the SDAC.  The Lecture\r\nQuiz and Exam dates are on the last page of the Syllabus.  You are required to start the Quiz\r\nand Exam at the same time as the class does. \r\n \r\nHonor:\r\nBecause of the Honor System at Mr. Jefferson's University, I assume students are truthful with\r\n teaching assistants and me and do not cheat on tests and exams.  In the unlikely event that you\r\nobserve an incident of cheating, I assume you will contact an Honor Advisor.  Students deemed\r\n(by the professor) to have violated the University's Honor System are not eligible for the Dutch\r\nknockout.\r\n \r\nLegal Note: \r\nStudents are prohibited from selling notes for this course to any person or commercial firm\r\n(or being paid to take notes) without the express written permission of Carter Doyle.\r\n \r\nOur Contract:\r\nThis syllabus is an important document. Continued enrollment in this course indicates your\r\nagreement with all stipulations laid out in this document.  All future discussions between you\r\nand me assume your continued agreement with this syllabus.\r\n  \r\nCourse Outline:\r\nTopic\rChapters\r\r\rPart I: Foundations of Economics\r\rCore Principles and Trade\r1,2\r\r\rPart II: Allocation by Price and Govt.

Statistics can\nbe a persuasive tool to support an argument and are sometimes stated as facts, but data\nanalysis is as much an art as a science and can be used to draw misleading conclusions.\nHow much truth is there in this headline?\nDoes this information apply to everyone?\nCan the data that was used be trusted?\nWere reasonable statistical methods used to\ngenerate this result?\nCould other conclusions have been drawn?\nOregon State University Ecampus\nResearch from November 2021\n\nQuestions like these help us identify the useful and\nappropriate information that can be gained from\ndata and statistical analysis.\n1\n\n\fInstructor information\nJeffrey Holt\nemail: jeff@virginia.edu\n\nLab section information\nSect 101: Monday/Wednesday\n\n5-5:50pm\n\nMonroe 110\n\nGTA Parker Snow\nEmily Brown\nKrishna Bhamidipati\n\nSect 102: Monday/Wednesday\n\n5-5:50pm\n\nMonroe 134\n\nGTA Yiting Wang\nPeter Hood\nIra Kelkar\n\nSect 103: Monday/Wednesday\n\n5-5:50pm\n\nGilmer 257\n\nGTA Jingyi Zhang\nClaire Cebula\nEthan Devarapalli\n\nSect 104: Monday/Wednesday\n\n6-6:50pm\n\nMonroe 110\n\nGTA Parker Snow\nEmily Brown\nKrishna Bhamidipati\n\nSect 105: Monday/Wednesday\n\n6-6:50pm\n\nMonroe 134\n\nGTA Yiting Wang\nPeter Hood\nIra Kelkar\n\nSect 106: Monday/Wednesday\n\n6-6:50pm\n\nGilmer 257\n\nGTA Jingyi Zhang\nEliza Boyce\nCharis Lee\n\nSect 107: Monday/Wednesday\n\n7-7:50pm\n\nChemistry 204\n\nGTA Xiaowen Wang\nCharis Lee\nKathleen Yung\n\nSect 108: Monday/Wednesday\n\n7-7:50pm\n\nChemistry 206\n\nGTA Yumiao Hui\nEliza Boyce\nMelissa Huang\n\nSect 109: Monday/Wednesday\n\n8-8:50pm\n\nChemistry 204\n\nGTA Xiaowen Wang\nCharis Lee\nKathleen Yung\n\nSect 110: Monday/Wednesday\n\n8-8:50pm\n\nChemistry 206\n\nGTA Yumiao Hui\nEliza Boyce\nMelissa Huang\n\nThe graduate teaching assistants (GTA) are PhD students in the Statistics Department.\nAll other lab section staff are third- and fourth-year statistics majors.\n\n2\n\n\fCommunication information and policies\nDrop-in hours\nDrop-in hours will begin on January 20 and will be held on days that classes are in session.\n\nDrop-in hours policies\nThe following policies will apply to all drop-in hours to be able to answer as many questions\nas possible. The drop-in hours are suitable for discussing a specific problem or assignment,\nhow to succeed in the class, or general academic matters.\n\u2022 All drop-in hours will be open-door, no appointment necessary. To discuss personal\nsituations, please schedule an appointment with the professor by sending an email.\n\u2022 Please arrive prepared with specific questions.\n\u2022 Do not expect that variations of the questions \u201cHow do I start this?\u201d, \u201cIs this correct?\u201d\nor \u201cWhat is wrong with this?\u201d will be answered. Instead, be prepared to explain the\nprocess you have already tried and why you are unsure about the next steps.\n\u2022 Do not expect that there will be space available in the room to sit and continue to\nwork. (Sometimes there might be, sometimes not.)\n\u2022 Do not expect that significant portions of material from a missed class will be explained.\n\nCommunication\nIt is most efficient to ask questions in person, either during office hours or\nbefore/during/after lecture or lab. Communication with the instructor outside of class\ntime and drop-in hours will vary depending on the subject for discussion.\n\u2022 For personal situations, please contact the instructor by email. Please note that these\nmessages are checked approximately once per day and responses will be may take\nseveral days.\n\u2022 For class content questions, please post on Piazza. If course staff receive an email\nabout class content questions, they will very likely direct you to post the question on\nPiazza. This will delay your getting an answer.\n\n3\n\n\fPiazza posting policies\nPiazza should be used for all non-personal course questions.\n1. Existing posts should be checked to determine if the question has already been asked.\n2. New posts should be clearly titled.\n3. Posting direct questions regarding or direct answers to course assignments is not permitted.\n4. Rude or offensive posts will not be tolerated. Such posts will be removed and if\nappropriate, disciplinary action will be taken.\n\nResource information\nSuggested textbook\nThe Practice of Statistics for Business and Economics (3rd ed.) by Moore, McCabe, Alwan,\nCraig, and Duckworth. Chapters corresponding to each topic are listed on the course schedule\nand these readings are suggested, but not required. A free electronic copy of this textbook\ncan be found on the course Canvas site.\n\nLaptop and statistical software\nPlan to bring a laptop to lab sections to complete the lab assignments. You should also have\nsome form of software downloaded to complete statistical analysis tasks. R will be presented\nthroughout the semester and is free, but analysis can be performed using various statistical\nsoftware programs (Excel, R, Python, SAS, etc.). Instructions to download R and RStudio,\nwhich is also free, are available through the UVA Library. Questions and problems can be\naddressed to res-consult@virginia.edu.\n\nCanvas\nAll lecture slides, assignments, announcements, and other materials will be posted to the\ncourse Canvas site. The Modules feature will be used to organize course materials, assignments, and assessments.\nGradescope\nAccess to Gradescope will be available through the course Canvas site. Gradescope will be\nused for lab assignment submissions and to provide exam feedback.\nPiazza\nAccess to Piazza will be available through the course Canvas site. You are encouraged to\nuse this resource to communicate with peers, GTAs, and the instructor outside of class time\nand office hours. Students can post and answer questions or share other relevant resources.\n4\n\n\fPeer Academic Coaching (PAC)\nPAC is a free peer coaching program available through the Georges Student Center in\nClemons Library. More information and the form to request peer coaching are available\non the PAC website.\n\nAssessment information and policies\nLab assignments\nA lab assignment will be completed during most lab meetings. These assignments are designed to provide an opportunity to practice applying the material taught during that day\u2019s\nlecture. Collaboration at each lab table is encouraged on these assignments, although all\nare required to finalize and submit their work individually by 11:59pm. It is the student\u2019s\nresponsibility to ensure that their work is saved and successfully submitted by the deadline.\nThere are absolutely no deadline extensions. However, the 6 lowest lab assignment\nscores will be dropped at the end of the semester, and the remaining lab assignments will\ncount equally toward the final lab assignment grade component.\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes will be completed weekly throughout the semester. These quizzes are designed to\nprovide an opportunity to demonstrate understanding of the concepts taught during the\nweek\u2019s lectures. Each quiz will consist of 3-7 problems and will be timed to be completed\nwithin 20 minutes. The quizzes are open notes (not open resource) but must be completed\nindividually by 9am on Mondays. There are absolutely no deadline extensions. However, the 3 lowest quiz grades will be dropped at the end of the semester, and the remaining\nquizzes will count equally towards the final quiz grade component.\n\nHomework assignments\nHomework assignments will be completed weekly throughout the semester. These assignments are designed to provide an opportunity to practice applying a broader scope of material. The homework assignment will consist of a mix of problems from the suggested textbook\nand problems drafted by the instructor, and are designed to be completed within 1-2 hours.\nThese assignments are designed to be completed by 9am on Mondays. Homework assignments will not be submitted for a score; instead, solutions will be made available\nfor self-grading.\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams during the semester. The scheduled dates are Wednesday Feb\n19 and Wednesday April 2. The exams will be given on paper and in person during lab\nmeetings. The format will be discussed prior to the each exam, though they are likely to\nconsist of a mix of multiple choice and short answer problems.\n5\n\n\fThere will be a make-up exam at 9am and 10am on the Friday following each exam. Make-up\nexams must be approved in advance and are only for circumstances beyond your control,\nsuch as serious illness or mandatory travel.
